# VC

This repository consists of the source code for the VC EU project, but also tools and make targets that's making sense for developers, please do not use for anything else.

Are you looking for running this, and need some sort of starting point, please take a look at <https://github.com/dc4eu/vc_up_and_running>

## docker release version

`latest` tracks the latest tag available and is build from branch `main`.

## branches

`main` is the stable development branch.

## How to build

### Docker

For convenience all services are build within a docker container.

Each service has its own make target, `make docker-build-<service>` or build all of them at once `make docker-build`

### Static binary without Docker

run `make build-<service>` to build a specific service or `make build` to build all services.

linux/amd64 is consider supported, other build options may work.

## Start, Stop & Restart

`make start` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --remove-orphans`

`make stop` or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml rm -s -f`

`make restart`
